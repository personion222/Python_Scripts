What it Does:
Gesture Control allows you to control your mouse, using just your hand and a webcam! Now all you need is a holographic
display, and you're basically a Hollywood character in real life!

How it Works:
Gesture Control works by using a library called Mediapipe to find the position of all your hand joints from your live
webcam footage. It then moves the mouse to the position of your right hand's index finger. To click, it detects if your
middle finger is folded down. If so, it'll press the left mouse button, and release it one you bring your middle finger
back up. The least finicky way of doing this is by touching your middle finger and your thumb.
