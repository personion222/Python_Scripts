What it Does:
Fruit Ripeness is a tool for colorblind people to find the ripeness of fruits! It currently only supports bananas, but
more fruits will be coming (hopefully) soon. To start, simply outline the banana in your live webcam footage with a
polygon using the left mouse button. To clear the selection, press the right mouse button. The little point on the bar
in the top left of the screen should then move according to how ripe the banana is. If it moves to the right, then it's
overripe. If it moves to the left, then it's underripe. To get the most accurate reading, outline the entire banana.

How it Works:
Fruit Ripeness works by taking the average color of the area within the polygon, and calculates a "ripeness score" using
the hue, saturation, and value of the banana, with hand-picked weights. To help you outline the banana, it finds the
edges in the webcam image, and tries to snap all the points in the polygon to an edge, to stop you from outlining just a
bit out of the banana, throwing off the average.
