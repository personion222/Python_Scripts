What it Does:
Face Crop is a webcam tool that crops in on just your face, so that you can be the center of attention in your video
calls or video recordings!

How it Works:
Face Crop works by using OpenCV and Haar Cascades to find the bounding box of your face from some live webcam footage.
It then runs a simple cropping algorithm on the image. After which, it scales the image to a set size, meaning that the size of
your video won't randomly change.
