What it Does:
Raycasting is a simple 3D viewer, using raycasting. Select the pygame window, with all the rays. Then, move around your
character using WASD, and Q and E to turn left and right respectively. You can click and drag to create rectangles that
your character can see, and right click on one to remove it. To erase all rectangles, middle click. The OpenCV window
shows the result of all the raycasts, and acts as a sort of "perspective" for your character.

How it Works:
Raycasting works by casting rays at the objects, and returning their hit distance, which shows up on the OpenCV window.
