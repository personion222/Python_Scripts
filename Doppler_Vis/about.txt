What it Does:
Doppler Vis is a simple tool to visualize the Doppler effect in real time in an interactive fashion. Using your webcam,
it looks for a piece of paper, and will emit "waves" in the form of circles from the location of the paper on screen, to
show the inner workings of the Doppler effect.

How it Works:
Doppler Vis uses the color of each pixel from your webcam, and a pre-defined color (the color of the piece of paper) for
it to look for. If a pixel is close to the color that it is looking for, it'll mark that pixel, and continue on. Once it
is done looking through all the pixels, it will take the median position of all the marked points, and add it to a
rolling average buffer. Using that rolling average buffer, it will draw that location on screen, as a circle, and emit
"waves" from it in the form of circles. If the piece of paper is moved, the waves being emitted from it will as well,
allowing you to visualize the Doppler effect in real time.
