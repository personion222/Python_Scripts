What it Does:
Adaptive Temperature makes your webcam video look more cinematic, by making some portions of the image cooler (blue-er)
and some portions of the image warmer (orange-er.)

How it Works:
Adaptive Temperature works by taking the darker pixels of your image, and making them cooler, and the lighter pixels of
your webcam look warmer.
