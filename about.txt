What it Does:
Amp Changes takes your webcam footage, and amplifies the little changes in the image; and makes them more noticeable

How it Works:
Amp Changes takes the current frame from your webcam, and compares it to the previous frame. It then takes the changes
from each pixel, and amplifies them, hence the name. However, I was noticing that it was amplifying little bits of
useless noise, making it more difficult to see the important changes. To fix that, I denoised the webcam footage before
feeding it to the program, and denoising it again after it comes out of the program, using a median filter denoising
algorithm.
