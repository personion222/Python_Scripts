What it Does:
Color Ramp uses your webcam video and turns it into any stylized color palette that you would like, using a color ramp.
It also allows you to change the amount of colors that it should be allowed to use, which can be limited to emulate
pixel art.

How it Works:
Color Ramp goes through every pixel from your webcam video, and uses a color ramp, from any two configurable colors. For
example, the two colors are pre-configured to be a dark blue, and a blue-ish green, to emulate a Nintendo Gameboy
display. To simplify the image, it can also round the color, to reduce the amount of colors that will be used it the
final image, to emulate pixel art
