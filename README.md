# Slime
Slime is a simulation, in which many agents go around eating food to stay alive, and if they stay too long without food they get removed. You can decide how much of each type of food should spawn, as well as how many agents, and their configuration. There are many more features in slime, too, such as viewing your fps and stats of your slime.
