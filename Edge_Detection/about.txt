What it Does:
Edge Detection looks at your webcam video, and detects edges within the image.

How it Works:
Edge Detection first blurs the video feed from your webcam using a box blur algorithm. It then goes through each pixel
of the blurred image, and compares it to the original, unblurred image. If there is a large change, it will mark that
pixel as an edge, by coloring it white. It then runs a median filter denoiser to remove any unwanted noise in the edge
image.
