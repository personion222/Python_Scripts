What it Does:
Background Remover is a simple tool to replace the background of an image. To start, move yourself, as well as any other
objects that you would like to not be included as the background, out of the frame, and run the program. Then, you can
move anything into the frame. The program will know that those objects weren't in the original image, and display them
in the viewing window.

How it Works:
Background Remover works by finding how different each pixel in the current webcam image is compared to the original,
background image, with no people in the frame. If the pixel is closer, it's probably just the background, and so it'll
replace it with another image of your choice. if it's further away, that's probably a new object, so it'll leave that
pixel as is.
